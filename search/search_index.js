Which data we do (not) process, for what purpose, how long, and on what legal basis 2.a Anonymous use of our website You can use our website anonymously. When you visit our website, your web browser will tell our web server your IP address to make communication possible.  It may be possible to identify you via your IP address.</p> <p>Each time you access the Internet offer of the Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Engineering gGmbH, the following data is stored in the server log files:</p> <ul> <li>Name of the retrieved file</li> <li>Date and time of retrieval</li> <li>Volume of data transferred</li> <li>Notification of whether the retrieval was successful</li> <li>IP address (in abbreviated form so that you are not identifiable)</li> <li>The web address from which the file was accessed (referrer URL)</li> <li>Information about the operating system and browser (user agent string)</li> </ul> <p>You remain completely anonymous to us when you visit our website. This anonymous data is evaluated for statistical puposes only.</p> <p>2.b Logging and evaluation in case of attacks Error messages\u2014which as a rule are the result of attempted attacks\u2014are recorded and evaluated with a complete IP address for security reasons. If no longer needed (for example, as evidence), this data will be deleted after seven days.</p> <p>The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 letter f GDPR. Legitimate interests in processing on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 letter f GDPR are to ensure the functionality and security of our website and to ward off attacks and other abuses.</p> <p>2.c Data processing in connection with general contact If you call us or send us a message, for example via the contact form or by email, we need your email address, your postal address or your telephone number to provide you an answer. Instead of your name, you may use a pseudonym. We will only use this information, as well as date and time of your contact, to process your request. Your data will not be passed on to third parties by us, but only used internally by the department that is responsible for your concern. We will delete your data as soon as it is no longer needed for this purpose. As a rule, this is three months after your last contact with us. If you should have any questions, please notify us again within this three month period. The legal basis for the processing of data are Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 letters b and f GDPR. The legitimate interests in processing on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 letter f GDPR is to fulfill your request.</p> <p>Exceptions: We are required to store business and commercial letters and other tax-relevant documents in order to fulfill the commercial and tax law archiving obligations. We will delete these documents by the 31st of March of the seventh calender year following their creation and, in the case of accounting receipts, the eleventh calender year following their creation. Our accounting department has access to these data. The legal basis for the tax law retention is Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 letter c GDPR in connection with \u00a7\u00a7 147 AO, 257 HGB.</p> <p>If your request is for a specific purpose (e.g., registration, request for a quotation, subscribing to the newsletter), only the explanations in the relevant section for that particular purpose apply to the processing of data.</p> <p>2.d Data processing when using third party content and web fonts Our website uses offers from third parties.These are Github and Youtube. Normally your web browser would automatically exchange information with these providers, such as your IP address. To prevent this, we use so-called two-click solutions. To use the offers of third party providers, it is necessary to first enable the data transfer to these third-party providers. Before this is done, none of your data will be sent to the third party provider, and you remain unknown to it. If you activate this button then information will be transmitted directly from your web browser to the respective provider. We then no longer have any influence on the processing of your data by third-party providers\u2014just as when you follow a link to another website. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 letter f GDPR; the legitimate interest is your wish to activate and use the third-party content.  </p> <p>Data that is thereby transferred include, for example, from which page you clicked on the button and your IP address. If you are logged in at the provider or if the provider can otherwise identify you (for example, via the cookies stored at your machine) the provider can link the information that you visited our website with other information about you, such as your user account at the provider. If you do not want the provider to associate this information with your other information, you should log out beforehand and, ideally, delete the cookies in your web browser.</p> <p>When you submit data to third-party providers, this data is subject to the privacy policies of those providers. We can assume no liability for this action. Please note that depending on the origin country of the third-party provider, the data privacy regulations may be less stringent than ours. Information about the data regulation of third-party providers is available here:</p> <p>https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement</p> <p>https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy</p> <p>3. Voluntary provision of your data You are not required to provide personal information to us. However, by not providing us with certain information (for example, how to contact you if you would like an answer from us), it is possible that we will be unable to complete your request. In the context of special procedures (for example, when you register for an event or our newsletter), you may again be required to provide us with certain information. Without this data we may not, for example, be able to process your registration or send you our newsletter. You will be expressly informed if this should be the case.</p> <p>4. Recipients of your data Generally, your personal data remains within our area of responsibility, except in special cases (e.g., co-operative events), in which we will then explicitly inform you to whom your data will be sent. If compelling circumstances arise, it may be necessary to pass on your data to external consultants, for example to lawyers in the case of legal disputes (legal basis Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 letter f GDPR; purpose and legitimate interest: the exercising, defending or asserting of legal rights). In certain areas, such as web hosting, e-mail hosting and event management, we use specialized service providers. These are strictly bound to our instructions with an order processing contract and are not allowed to process the data for their own purposes. Our data protection officer has extensive rights of control, accorded by Art. 37, 38 GDPR, and therefore access to personal data (legal basis Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 letter c in conjunction with Art. 37, 38 GDPR). Further recipients of your data are listed in the notes on the respective data processing. In certain cases, we may need to disclose your personal information to third parties so that you can receive the service you want; this means to vicarious agents, for example banks and other payment service providers or to postal service providers. In certain areas, such as web hosting and email hosting, we use specialized service providers. These providers are strictly bound by our instructions through an agreement on commissioned data processing and may not process the data for their own purposes. If in special cases (e.g., co-operative events with partners outside of the EU), your data will be transferred to third countries, we will inform you of this and, if required, also separately about the legal basis and level of data protection.</p> <p>5. Automated decision-making, profiling Your data will not be used for automated decision-making or profiling.</p> <p>6. Your rights Under the relevant legal requirements, you have the right to receive information about your data, the right to have such data corrected or deleted, the right to the restriction of processing, the right to object to processing, and the right to data tranferability. In particular, you have the right to object to the processing of your data for advertising purposes at any time without incurring costs other than the transmission costs, according to the rates of your provider (e.g., the costs of an email=usually none). This applies, for example, if you have registered for an event and do not wish  to be informed about similar events.  If the data processing is based on consent, you have the right to revoke your consent at any time without this affecting the legality of the processing being carried out on the basis of consent to revocation or processing on any other legal basis. If you want to exercise these rights, you can simply write to datenschutz(at)hpi.de or click on the unsubscribe link in any email newsletter to unsubscribe. If we call you, you can also communicate this to us directly.</p> <p>You also have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about our processing of your personal data, for example to the supervisory authority whom we answer to: Die Landesbeauftragte f\u00fcr den Datenschutz und f\u00fcr das Recht auf Akteneinsicht, Stahnsdorfer Damm 77, 14532 Kleinmachnow, Tel: +49 (0)33203 356-0, Fax: +49 (0)33203 356-49, Email: poststelle(at)lda.brandenburg.de.</p> <p>If you have questions or requests regarding data protection, you can contact us at any time. Your contact is: datenschutz(at)hpi.de.</p> <p>7. Your right to object to data processing Insofar as the processing of your personal data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 letter e or f GDPR, you have the right to object to processing in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR. If your objection is made for reasons arising from your particular situation, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise of defence against legal claims. If your opposition is directed against direct marketing, including profiling, insofar as it is connected with such direct mail, we will no longer process your personal data for these purposes.</p> <p>Version: 11.09.2024</p>"},{"location":"Blog/index.html","title":"Index","text":"<p>Inhalte zum Kurs Projektentwicklung und Teammanagement (2025/2026)</p> <p>Fallstudie Japan</p>"},{"location":"Blog/posts/AI-brainstorms.html","title":"AI brainstorms","text":"<p>In our aviation project, we started to think about ways to solve problems with drones.

Diese Reisenden suchten nach einer Unterkunft in direkter N\u00e4he zur Veranstaltung, da die guten Hotels ausgebucht waren.

Diese Hosts erweiterten das Angebot der Plattform. Sie gaben den Gr\u00fcndern tiefe Einblicke in die tats\u00e4chlichen Bed\u00fcrfnisse und Herausforderungen der Nutzer.

Unsere Aufgabe war es, neue digitale Lernangebote f\u00fcr Sch\u00fcler zu entwickeln. Viele meiner Kollegen waren \u00fcberzeugt, die Bed\u00fcrfnisse ihrer Nutzer genau zu kennen. Doch in einem Interview mit einer Mutter, deren Sohn Schwierigkeiten mit Englisch hatte, wurde klar, dass es viel zu entdecken gab.</p> <p>Die Mutter erz\u00e4hlte, wie m\u00fchsam das Lernen f\u00fcr ihn war \u2013 bis sich pl\u00f6tzlich seine Noten verbesserten. Neugierig fragte ich nach: \u201eWarum?\u201c Sie wusste es nicht genau, \u00fcberlegte und sagte schlie\u00dflich, dass er regelm\u00e4\u00dfig beim Online-Gaming Englisch sprach. Ihre Aussage \u201eEnglisch hat er \u00fcber seine Egoshooter gelernt\u201c brachte das Team zum Nachdenken. Uns wurde bewusst, wie wichtig es ist, in Interviews Raum f\u00fcr solche unerwarteten Einsichten zu lassen.</p> <p>Statt direkter Fragen nach Bed\u00fcrfnissen frage ich gezielt nach Erlebnissen. Drei zentrale Signale, auf die ich dabei achte:</p> <p>Starke Meinungen, die oft auf tieferliegende Werte und Bed\u00fcrfnisse hinweisen. Emotionale Reaktionen, die zeigen, welche Themen besonders relevant sind. Widerspr\u00fcche, die ungel\u00f6ste Konflikte oder unerkannte Bed\u00fcrfnisse darstellen. Die letzten Minuten eines Interviews sind entscheidend. Hier fassen wir das Geh\u00f6rte zusammen und kl\u00e4ren zentrale Aussagen, um tiefer in die Sichtweise der Interviewten einzutauchen.</p> <p>Diese Techniken sind hilfreich, um das Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr die Nutzer zu vertiefen.
