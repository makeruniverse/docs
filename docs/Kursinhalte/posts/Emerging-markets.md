Startups often flourish in emerging markets. But how do you spot a market in the making?

One promising way is to observe what [the nerds are doing on the weekends](https://cdixon.org/2013/03/02/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years).

In this context, "nerds" are early adopters. They are early adopters of new products that are typically flawed and of poor quality. Despite most other people, early adopters tolerate poor quality in a product they really want to have in their lives.

For example, in 2007, a former colleague of mine, Christian, introduced me to podcasting. At that time, no one else I knew, had even heard about it. As I found out quickly, finding podcast files was a mess, there were no podcast apps, and podcasts weren't available on streaming sites. Additionally, most podcasts sounded like they were recorded in a bunker.

Christian, a programmer with a love for Berlin's electronic music scene, didn't mind these flaws. He would listen to podcasts during long coding sessions at night. For him, podcasting was the only offer that allowed him to listen to interesting niche-content. In that sense he was an early adopter.

Observing early adopters like Christian is one valid way to understand new markets in the making. At a time, when it's not yet obvious to everyone.
