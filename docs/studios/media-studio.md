If the transmitters cannot establish a connection to the receiver, the blue "∞" button on the transmitters lights up. To pair the transmitter with the receiver again,press the '∞' button on the receiver for three seconds. After this, switch the transmitter on again using the power button.<br />
    To disconnect a transmitter from the receiver, select the transmitter to be disconnected using the pairing or channel button and hold this button for three seconds.

    You can decide whether you want to record in "Merged" or "Split" mode. In "Split" mode, both channels are recorded as separate audio tracks. You can tell that "Split" mode is switched on by the presence of two output levels. The individual audio tracks can be edited in post-production.<br />
    Split mode is particularly suitable for interviews with two people, as each audio track is recorded separately and can be edited. In "Merged" mode, the receiver combines the recordings into one audio track. To use the different modes, press the two buttons on the receiver simultaneously.
