Access to some of our machines / tools in the Hardware Studio is managed over [Fabman](https://fabman.io) (e.g. the laser cutter and soldering stations). Upon completion of a training (clicking on the button below the videos), we will automatically create your Fabman account in our Maker Universe. You will receive an email with a link to set your password and log in to Fabman. After that, you are ready to go and use our machines. To turn on the machines, you will need to use your smartphone and scan the QR code on the Fabman bridge (a little black box next to each machine). Alternatively you can now use your HPI key to sign into the bridge! Use the button below to create an account without completing a training yet or pair your key. If you have further questions feel free to contact us!

## Label Printer: QL-820NWBc

This QL-820NWBc can print up to 62mm in width. If wider: You might change the orientation of the label in the software to fit the label on the printer.

You can use the printer via Wi-Fi (hpi-studios) and via USB. You can find the software on our Modeler Workstation.

## 3D Printers
### Bambu A1 Mini
Use Bambu a1 Mini when you print small objects with a single filament.

### Bambu X1
Use Bambu X1x when you print large objects of up to 256 x 256 x 265 mm, or objects with up to four different types or filaments.

**Warning**
The Bambu has a Snakehouse Fan Duct, which is a bit too close to the bed, on the left of the enclosure. If thin/fragile parts are located on the left side of the bed, near to the edge, they might warp due to the fan blowing on it. If that happens disable the AUX Fan and print with open enclosure: [OrcaSlicer AUX Fan Settings](../3D_Printing/img/auxfan-orca.png)

### Prusa XL
Use Prusa XL when you print large objects and / or objects with multiple filament types.

To use all features of the Prusa XL we recommend to use [Download: Prusa Slicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/en/page/prusaslicer_424/)
You can send jobs remotely with [prusa connect](https://connect.prusa3d.com/)

If you want to use various nozzle widths in one print, you need to use simplify 3d for slicing.
we have a profile for Prusa XL here:

??? "Printing with Vector Files"

    It's possible to import SVG files into the slicing software, give them a thickness (extrude) and 3d print them.
    This works in Pruse SLicer, Orca Slicer & Bambu Studio.

    Import your SVG file, the printer will directly show an extruded version with a height of 10mm.
    For creating small signs set Z-height to 2mm (uncheck uniform scale) and adjust XY scale as needed.

- [ ] import model in OrcaSlicer
- [ ] use "auto orient" to position model
- [ ] select textured PEI plate for PLA
- [ ] check if model needs support structure
- [ ] assign filament
- [ ] print on one of our printers
- [ ] tag printer with your name

??? "Alternative: Use Orca Slicer on your Laptop"
    https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer

    Install with brew: `brew install orcaslicer`
    AUR: `orca-slicer`
The easiest way to use the printers is sending files remotely. Upon installation you will be asked if you want to install the network plugin. We recommend to do this. The login credentials are:
