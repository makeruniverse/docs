The Phone Stand Project is a chance to learn to make a threedimensional model and 3D print the model in a single afternoon.

Our Head of Media Studios @markus.wutzlhofer designed this project to teach students the essentials about the Blender and OrcaSlicer software.

The software is accessible in our workstations in our Media Studio. Printing materials are also available at any time in our Maker Studio.
