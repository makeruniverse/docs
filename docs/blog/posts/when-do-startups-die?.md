An great heuristic I've seen in companies is when managers go all-in on teams that show a high level of energy, irrespective of whether it is a top priority project or not. 

Like startups, project teams also don't die when they run out of cash; they die when their members run out of energy.

Go to where the energy is. This is where progress happens.
