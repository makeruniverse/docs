Being a manager of a product team is an interesting challenge. It's not true, that teams of makers don't like to managed. Also, they don't mind a plan. What is true however is that they won't commit to a schedule. 

In other words: Try to commit a maker to a schedule. Either the maker or the schedule will fall apart.

Paul Graham [highlights](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) the clash between a manager's and a maker's schedule. Managers' days are broken up by meetings, and planned by others. Makers, however, strive when they work through long, uninterrupted time periods.
