Paul Graham [highlights](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) the clash between a manager's and a maker's schedule. Managers' days are broken up by meetings, and planned by others. Makers, however, strive when they work through long, uninterrupted time periods.

In other words: Try to commit a maker to a schedule. Either the maker or the schedule will fall apart.
