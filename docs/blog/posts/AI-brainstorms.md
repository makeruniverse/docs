In our [aviation project](/docs/projects/projects.md/#rc-airplane-by-nikita), we started to think about ways to solve problems with drones. We came up with the ususal suspects: surveillance, last mile deliveries and video productions.

So, I asked ChatGTP. The first results I received overlapped with the ones from our project team. Probably, our human brains and the AI model refered to the same use cases that have been published somewhere else in the past.

I then started to feed the AI with constraints: "imagine you are Ikea, how would you use drones to strengthen your business model?" "imagine, no Wi-Fi is available, how can drones be useful in that scenario?"

More and more stranger and unusual ideas appeared on my screen. I ended up with detailed descriptions of how swarms of drones can coordinate themselves in cases of public emergencies where there is Wi-Fi available, anymore.

Radical new innovations originate from strange ideas. These are ideas that "look bad to almost everyone" first, until they turn out to be good. (Alejandro Lecuna)

This is where the AI can benefit us. AI can generate all kinds of strange looking ideas. They are oftentimes factually wrong, they are inconsistent, and full of biases. 

But they are also valuable.

If we resist the urge to judge the AI's outcome for its flaws, and instead practice to look at it curiously, even naive, by asking ourselves: "This is strange. But what if...?"
