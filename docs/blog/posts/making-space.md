We continuously developed our studios over the last months.

In May 2024, we build a second workbench and laser cutting workstation, training 35 students in its use. We also set up a user research studio that was booked for a full 19 days during the semester, by PhDs and Master students.

In June 2024, we re-designed our Media Studio into a self-service space, where students shoot photos, videos, record podcasts, and use teleprompters without bookings and further assistance. We also enhanced the usability of our Superposition workstation, where dozens of student teams collaborate, often late into the night. Despite some technical flaws, the positive feedback has been encouraging.
