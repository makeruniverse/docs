In the summer of 2007, I met a programmer named Christian at a short-lived startup. Christian was ecstatic about something I had never heard before: podcasting.

Back then, podcasting wasn’t as accessible as it is today. There were no podcasting apps. Christian had to scour personal websites to find audio files, download them, and listen to them on his computer during late-night coding breaks. Most of these amateur-made podcasts sounded like they were recorded in a bunker, with low-quality audio and a DIY spirit.

Despite my interest in the concept, the primitive state of podcasting deterred me. But not Christian. He tolerated bad audio quality and usability issues because, for him, audio was the ultimate medium. He not only consumed but also crafted his own podcast experiments.

In that context, Christian was part of a small, well-connected group of early adopters who embraced new products long before they became mainstream. Tim Ferriss once said something along the lines, that if you want to understand what is coming next, you need to watch out for "what the nerds are doing on the weekends." In 2007, Christian and others were deep into podcasting, well ahead of the curve.

Reflecting on this almost twenty years later, I wonder what today’s nerds are doing on the weekends. The ones willing to embrace new offers before they become polished or widely accessible. To show us what’s ahead of the next curve.
