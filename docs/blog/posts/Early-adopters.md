Listening to podcasts has become my most consistent hobby, and I still vividly recall my first encounter with it. In the summer of 2007, I met a programmer named Christian at a short-lived startup. Christian was ecstatic about something I had never heard before: podcasting.

Back then, podcasting wasn’t as accessible as it is today. There were no apps or directories. Christian had to scour personal websites to find audio files, download them, and listen to them on his computer during late-night coding breaks. Most of these amateur-made podcasts sounded like they were recorded in a bunker, with low-quality audio and a DIY spirit.

Despite my interest in the concept, the primitive state of podcasting deterred me. But not Christian. He tolerated bad audio quality and usability issues because, for him, audio was the ultimate medium. He not only consumed podcasts but also created his own.

In that context, Christian was an innovator, part of a small, well-connected group of early adopters who embraced new products long before they became mainstream. Tim Ferris once said, "If you want to understand what is coming next, you need to watch out for what the nerds are doing on the weekends." In 2007, Christian and a few others were deep into experimenting with podcasts, well ahead of the curve.

Reflecting on this almost twenty years later, I wonder what today’s nerds are doing on the weekends. Those willing to embrace new ideas and technologies before they become polished or widely accepted are the ones who show us what’s ahead of the curve.
