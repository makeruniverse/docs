Where do we find ideas in the making? The ones that are ahead of the curve. 

A great heuristic is to look out for what [the nerds are doing on the weekends](https://cdixon.org/2013/03/02/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years): not the Netflix shows they are watching, or the video games they are playing. More interesting to us are the half-baked products and ideas that they also spent their time with.

Nerds, or: early adopters, don't mind half-baked products that come with flaws, as long as they adress the needs they have. And this is where things get interesting, if you want to have success in markets.

For example, in 2007, it became obvious to me that podcasting would become a bigger thing. At that time almost nobody I knew, had a clue about podcasting. But some nerds did.

In the summer of 2007, I met Christian, a programmer whith whom I worked together at a short-lived startup. Christian was the first person I met, who listened to podcasts.

I also liked the idea of podcasting. But I didn't like the user experience: Finding files was a mess since there we no podcast apps, and no one seemed to share them on streaming sites. The podcasts you would eventually find, sounded like they were made in a bunker.

Christian didn't mind these flaws. He would program his own tool to crawl for podcasts, and he would listen to them late at night on his computer during coding-breaks. To him, podcasting was the ultimate solution for his need to consume interesting content. As an early adopter, he was ready to use half-baked solutions. In that sense he was the canary in the coal mine. If you want to understand emerging markets, you need to understand their early adopters.

It took me five more years, before I finally started to consume podcasts on a regular basis. What happened? Podcasting then came along with a convenient user experience. Smart phones made it possible to find podcasts and to listen to them on-the-go. At that time, everybody kind of knew that podcasting would become a market of its own.
