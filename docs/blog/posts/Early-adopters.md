In the summer of 2007, I met a programmer named Christian at a short-lived startup. Christian was ecstatic about something I had never heard before: podcasting.

I immediately liked the idea of podcasting, but not the product. At that time, finding podcasts was difficult - there we no podcast apps, and no one shared podcast files on the then-popular music streaming sites. Most podcasts back then sounded like they were made in a bunker.

Christian on the other hand didn't mind all these flaws. To him, podcasting was the ultimate solution for his need to consume interesting content. Christian was a so-called early adopter. A small group of people who are actively looking for new ideas for in their scope of interest. 

I on the other hand jumped on the podcasting train five years later when podcasting finally offered convenient and pleasant user experience with podcast apps, and devices at hand to listen to content on-the-go.

This blog post is about the importance of people like Christian. 

Early adopters are the ones who embrace new ideas first, and who actively support companies and startups in improving their ideas so that they eventually become mainstream products.

Tim Ferriss once said that we find inspiration by observing what the "nerds are doing on the weekends." Well, back in 2007, you would have had the chance to observe people like Christian to understand that podcasting would become a big thing. This is what we know in hindsight.

What's important now is to understand what today's nerds are doing on the weekends: not the video games they play, or the shows they watch. But the half-baked ideas they already embrace despite their poor user experience. This is where we find innovations in the making.
