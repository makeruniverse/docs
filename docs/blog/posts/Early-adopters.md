Startups have several advantages over established companies. One key advantage is their ability to focus on emerging markets. But what exactly are emerging markets?

A great heuristic to identify an emerging market is to observe what [the nerds are doing on the weekends](https://cdixon.org/2013/03/02/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years).

In this context, "nerds" are the early adopters. They engage with market offerings that are irrelevant to the majority, not because their needs are vastly different, but because they tolerate products with poor quality.

For example, in 2007, my friend Christian introduced me to the concept of podcasting. At the time, no one else I knew had even heard of it. I liked the idea, but the user experience was lacking. Finding podcast files was a mess, there were no podcast apps, and podcasts were not available on streaming sites. Additionally, most podcasts sounded like they were recorded in a bunker. It took several more years before I started to consume podcasts regularly.

Christian, however, was different. As a programmer who had moved to Berlin for the electronic music scene, he would listen to podcasts during long coding sessions at night. For him, podcasting was the perfect solution for consuming interesting content that wasn't available on the radio. He was one of the early adopters who tolerated the flaws of this new medium.

In contrast, I became part of the early majority that began consuming podcasts only after the user experience had significantly improved. What changed? Smartphones. With the advent of smartphones, it became easy to find and listen to podcasts anywhere. However, the market had been developing long before this mainstream adoption.
