In the summer of 2007, I met Christian, a programmer whith whom I worked together at a short-lived startup. Christian was ecstatic about something I hadn't heard before: podcasting.

I immediately liked the idea of podcasting. The idea, but not the user experience around it. Finding podcasts was a mess - there we no podcast apps, and no one seemed to share podcast files on streaming sites. The podcasts you would find eventually, sounded like they recorded made in a bunker. I listened to a few and that was it.

It took 5 more years, before I started to consume a lot of podcasts. What happened? Podcasting finally became a convenient user experience. There were podcast apps, and smart phones so that I could listen to content on-the-go.

But this blog post is not about me. It is about people like Christian.

Already in 2007, Christian consumed and created his own podcasts, despite the many flaws. To him, podcasting was the ultimate solution for his need to consume interesting content. 

Christian was a so-called early adopter: a small group of people who are actively looking for new ideas for in their scope of interest. Early adopters are the ones who embrace and actively support new ideas until they eventually can become maintream products.

Tim Ferriss once said that we find inspiration by observing what the "nerds are doing on the weekends." 

In hindsight, I could have realized in 2007 that podcasting would become a big thing, by observing Christian and others.

What are today's nerds doing on the weekends? And I don't mean the shows they are watching or the video games they are playing, as these activities are already catered by mainstream products. I am talking about the half-baked ideas they fell in love with. The ones that come with a poor user experience. This is where innovations happen.
