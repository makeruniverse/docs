Great teams start with the intent to solve a problem. They do this by identifying problems worth solving. However, recognizing a problem isn't enough. Makers also need to evaluate existing solutions and envision something significantly better.

Paul Graham's [blog post](https://www.paulgraham.com/google.html) serves as a powerful reminder that companies like Google and Facebook didn't begin as startups; they started as team projects. These were groups of individuals with a keen interest in solving specific problems, not necessarily with a business model in mind.

Consider Google in 1998: "How can we fix internet search?"

Contrast this with a failing startup in 2024: "How can we make money out of AI?"

The difference is clear. Successful teams start with a problem to solve, not just a business case.
