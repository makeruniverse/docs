**How do I design for usability?**

Imagine this scenario: You are in New York. You are supposed to meet a stranger in the city within the next 24 hours, without any chance to communicate with them. 

Where do you go? And when?

It turns out that people are likely to end up on top of the Empire State Building at Noon.

In this thought experiment, the Empire State Building serves as a [Schelling Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtW-Ds-artA). The existence of Schelling Points indicates that coordination without communication is possible.

Now, imagine this: You are part of a product team developing a revolutionary AI-powered user experience with no buttons or interfaces. Everything is speech-controlled. Identifiying the Schelling Points in your product experience will determine whether your products are either user-friendly or confusing.
