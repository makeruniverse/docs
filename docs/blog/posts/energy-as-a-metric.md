The level of energy within a team is the best - if not the only - metric to measure the progress of an innovation project.

Energy is what keeps projects and startups alive, not money or good will. 
 
Project teams that are exploring new opportunites are well advised to do whatever releases energy. It might not always be in line with their initial goals, and it may not lead to final answers, but it will eventually get them somewhere. Follow the energy, and results will come.
