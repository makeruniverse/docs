Innovation projects start with a problem but without a known solution. 

In other words: Our goal in any innovation project is to find out what our goal is. 

Which makes it hard to measure progress. We cannot know how many tasks we have to accomplish, if we don't know the solution yet.

But progress is more than the amount of tasks we accomplish. It is about energy.

It is the energy that keeps teams going until they get somewhere. Energy is what keeps projects alive, not money.
