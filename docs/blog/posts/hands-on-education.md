Our ambition for this semester was to offer and test new hands-on learning experiences.

In April 2024, we began producing video tutorials on using tools like the laser cutter and 3D printer. These are accessible via QR codes in studios and on our website.

Until July 2024, we educated 128 students and employees in 18 workshops. We achieved a net promoter score (NPS) of 67, surpassing the Harvard Business Schoolâ€™s benchmark of 41.

We initiated 9 long term projects in which students develop ambitious prototypes at the intersection of hardware and software. The students teach other peers through workshops and video tutorials how to re-build their prototypes. By July 2024, 3 out of 9 projects were completed.
