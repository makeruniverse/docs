In the next semester 24/25, we remain committed to exploring new hands-on-learning experiences through ambitious maker projects. Three projects are in our focus:

**Ambitious Maker Projects**

While our Maker Studio is well-equipped, not all students have the skills to fully utilize these resources. We plan to allocate more continuous support and expertise for ambitious projects, beyond the sporadic support currently offered by our freelance hardware experts.

**Superposition 2.0**

Based on student feedback, we believe our Superposition setup can become a blueprint for better collaboration. We'll invest in hardware to ensure seamless connectivity and delay-free operations.

**User Research Every Day**

We'll relocate the user research setup to a quieter space, providing better conditions for researchers. This move will also free up the previous space for student projects.
