Unlike in art, we can mutually agree on what constitutes good design. As users, we all know the difference between well-designed and poorly designed products. As product builders, it’s crucial to remember what good design entails.

Braun innovator Dieter Rams wrote a [famous manifesto](https://designmuseum.org/discover-design/all-stories/what-is-good-design-a-quick-look-at-dieter-rams-ten-principles) on the principles of good design. I believe the fourth principle is the most important: "Good design makes a product understandable."

Users don't want to read manuals; they want to get the job done and use the product immediately. Technically, they want to navigate the product without needing further assistance from manuals, call centers, or forums.

How can we, as product builders, ensure this ease of use?

We need to understand Schelling Points.

Let me explain with a thought experiment:

Imagine you are in New York and need to meet a stranger within the next 24 hours. The stranger has the same task: to meet you. There is no communication between you two.

So, where do you go? And when?

Statistics suggest that you will likely succeed if you go to the top of the Empire State Building at noon.

Why? Among all the places and times, the Empire State Building at noon serves as a Schelling Point. Because, when in doubt, people choose the most obvious options.

This concept applies to product design. To make the user experience intuitive, you need to anticipate how users will interact with your product without any guidance. You can achieve this by stepping into the user’s shoes and testing your design early in the development process.
