**Teams in innovation projects do not follow specific outcomes; so what orientation is left for them?**

Innovation teams need to keep going, until they find something valuable: an insight, an anomaly. The faster they keep going, the faster they find something.

Any direction that releases energy within a team is therefore valuable. It might not lead to final answers, but it will get them somewhere. Energy is what keeps projects alive. Not money, not good will. 

From a team leader perspective, the level of energy within a team is likely to be the  best - if not the only - metric to measure the progress of an innovation project.
