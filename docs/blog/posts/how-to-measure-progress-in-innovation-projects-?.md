Our goal in an innovation project is to find out what the goal is. 

Since we don't know the end result, it is impossible to measure our progress terms of accomplished work packages and tasks.

But we can sense energy. Like any team, energetic teams may also not get things right. But it is the energy that keeps them going until they get there.

Energy is what keeps projects alive, not money.
