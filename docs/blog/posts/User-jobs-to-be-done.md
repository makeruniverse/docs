If you want to make something useful for someone, the first think you need to do is to stop thinking of them as customers. Rather, acknowledge them as potential user. 

Users don't buy your products. They don't want to be anyone's customers. All they want is to use a product as sort of a tool to get a job done.

They alway want to get from from "A" to "B". And it is on us to know what their "A" and "B" looks like.
