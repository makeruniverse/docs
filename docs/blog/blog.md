## User Research - and why I still refer to human beings as "users"
"User-centered? Haven't we moved beyond that?" A design professor posed this question at one of public post about user interviews—not as an actual question but as a "feedback”. She implied that "we" now embrace the term "human-centered" in research and design, leaving "user-centered" in the past.

So, are we talking about users or humans? Debating terms rarely leads to practical outcomes, yet I find it necessary to clarify a potential misunderstanding. Am I really regarding human beings as "passive subjects" by using the term "user"?

No.

When I use the term “user research”, I am referring to the tools and methods we, as researchers, designers, and product managers, can apply. Our methods involve field observations, questionnaires, interviews, A/B testing, and recently, technology to monitor brain waves and health indicators. The methods and tools allow us to observe how they react to prompts, and how they use tools in each situation. And this level of abstraction, described as user behaviors, is an honest appraisal of our tools.

In fact, it would be presumptuous to imply that we could even grasp human beings in their psychological and social complexity with these tools. We don’t explore what human beings and their underlying motives are. We explore their behavior as users.
