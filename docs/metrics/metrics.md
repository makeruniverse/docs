Our goals. And potential indicators of progress.

## SMART Goals

Our SMART goals are focused on engaging students in creating a unique hands-on-learning experience.

### Goal#1: Maker Projects

Our goal#1 is to empower students to complete **10 maker projects** by 31.12.2024.

We will support students to complete maker-, media-, and research-related projects by offering tools, materials, and expertise.

We will video document student projects as tutorials so that future students can rebuild ideas at their own pace.

    8 Maker Projects started / 2 Maker Projects completed

### Goal#2: Education

Our goal#2 is to teach maker skills to **100 students** by 31.12.2024. 

Students will participate in workshops and tutorials that are part of maker projects. They will thereby actively learn new maker skills.

We aim to achieve an outstanding educational quality, by a **Net Promoter Score of 41+** on average , across all maker workshops and tutorials.

### Goal#3: Community

Our goal#3 is to, on average, attract **70 visits per weekday** in our Studios by 31.12.2024, which is supposedly sufficient to ensure that like-minded makers eventually meet each other and explore ideas for new projects together.

We aim to achieve an outstanding community experience that is highly recommended among students with a **Net Promoter Score of 41+**.
