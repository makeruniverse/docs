In our first Maker Project, Master Student Florian prepared a workshop for other students. Here, they learned how to connect sensors to circuit boards to measure and calibrate the moisture level of plants. The same ESP can trigger water pumps to create a self-watering setup.

More students are now picking up the work of Florian and are planning to iterate on the initial setup.

We document their efforts so that future students can rebuild the prototypes. Also, students will soon find pre-packaged bags with all components that are needed to make smart plants.
