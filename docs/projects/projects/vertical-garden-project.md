PhD Candidate @elizabeth.yuu builds the Yuu-Gardens! A vertical, self-watering in door gardening system to grow vegetables and salads. We are experimenting with different prototypes to aim at energy- and ressource-efficiency. 

Ultimately, several sensor-based gardening systems that are connected to a home assistant system that will deliver data for future research.

Elizabeth is interesting collaborating with other students. Many have already joined our vertical-garden Slack Channel to meet and plan collaborative maker sessions.

The Media Studio of the Maker Universe is preparing a video tutorial so that future students can re-build the prototypes that turned out to be succesful.
