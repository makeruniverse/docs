Smart Clothing is a Bachelor Project from 2024 / 2025. <br />

This project aims to explore integrating cutting-edge sensor technology into everyday clothing. Imagine a
world where your shoes and hoodie can monitor your health and provide real-time feedback without needing
extra devices.

The project is supervised by Prof. Bert Anrich (Digital Health) and PhD Candidate Orhan Konak (Digital Health). Dr. Holger Rhinow (HPI Maker Universe) serves as the internal project partner.
