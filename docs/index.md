**Start your maker journey** today. Visit us in House K, Mondays to Fridays between 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM. Our studios are open for all HPI students, affiliated students, researchers, and employees.

You can also join a guided tour every Tuesday 10:00 AM in the Maker Universe in House K (Ground Floor). No need to register.

## Tools

Our studios are packed with [tools](./tools/tools.md) to work on ideas at the intersection of hardware and software. You are not alone in this: we have [experts](./team/team.md) that can help you.

## Projects

We partner with HPI teams, students, and researchers in executing on projects. We also document [projects](./projects/projects.md) - as an inspiration for future students.

## Blog

Our Head of Maker Universe, Holger, is [taking notes](./blog/index.md) on maker projects: lessons learnt from teams and their projects.

## Metrics

The Maker Universe is a rather new on-campus experience. With our [metrics](./metrics/metrics.md) we aim to openly share what success would like for us. 

## Community

This Github repository is a knowledge base for all of us - supported by students. We are looking forward to your contributions.
