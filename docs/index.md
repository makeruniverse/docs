**Welcome**

The Maker Studios are for everyone to explore, create, and share their ideas. 

To make this possible, we ask you to keep two key principles in mind: First, offer feedback to fellow makers only when requested. Focus on being supportive. Second, keep the space clean and tidy. For others to enjoy.

You can find our studios on Campus 1 in House K. We are open Mondays to Fridays between 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM.
