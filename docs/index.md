**Welcome to the HPI Maker Universe**

The HPI Maker Universe is a network of **Studios**: so-called Maker Studios, a Media Studio, and a Research Studio. Here, we offer **services and tools** to support Bachelor-, Master-, PhD-, and individual project ideas.

You can find our Studios on Campus 1 in House K. We are open Mondays to Fridays between 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM. Our Studios are open to HPI students, HPI researchers, visting researchers, and employees.
